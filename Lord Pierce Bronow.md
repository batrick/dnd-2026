## 📖 APPENDIX: TACTICAL GUIDE

### 🎯 Scenario A: The Boss Killer (Single Strong Enemy)
*Goal: Maximize single-target damage and accuracy.*

* **Preferred Action:** **Attack** with Pike (Reach 10 feet).
* **Preferred Bonus Action:** **Vow of Enmity** (Channel Divinity) for Advantage.
* **Sentinel Reaction:** If the Boss attacks an ally within 5 feet of you, you get a free reaction attack. This is an excellent opportunity to trigger **Divine Smite** off-turn.
* **Key Spells:**
    * **Hunter's Mark (Bonus Action):** Cast this immediately. *Benefit:* Adds +1d6 damage per hit. **Note:** Due to House Rules, this does *not* require Concentration, allowing you to stack it with Bless.
    * **Divine Smite (Bonus Action):** Use after you land a critical hit or when you need burst damage.
    * **Shield of Faith (Bonus Action):** If the boss hits hard, boost your Armor Class to 19.

### 🛡️ Scenario B: The Party Leader (Buff & Support)
*Goal: Improve ally accuracy and keep them alive.*

* **Preferred Action:** **Cast Bless**.
    * *Effect:* You and 2 allies add +1d4 to Attacks and Saving Throws. This is mathematically huge for the party's success rate.
* **Preferred Bonus Action:** **Shout Instruction** or **Lay on Hands**.
* **Sentinel Defense:** Position yourself adjacent to squishy allies (Wizard/Rogue). If an enemy attacks them, **Sentinel** grants you a retaliatory strike, punishing the enemy for ignoring you.
* **Key Spells:**
    * **Bless (Action):** The best mathematically defensive and offensive buff for the group.
    * **Healing Word (Bonus Action - Item):** Use this from your Enspelled Symbol to revive a downed ally from 60 feet away.
    * **Cure Wounds (Action):** Use only if an ally is critical and you are next to them; heals significantly more than Healing Word (2d8+Modifier).

### 🌪️ Scenario C: Crowd Control (Many Weak Enemies)
*Goal: Debuff enemies and manage the battlefield.*

* **Preferred Action:** **Cast Bane**.
    * *Effect:* 3 Enemies take -1d4 penalty to Attacks and Saves. Good against mobs with low Charisma.
* **Preferred Bonus Action:** **Abjure Enemy** (Channel Divinity).
    * *Effect:* Frightens one enemy and reduces their speed to 0. Great for stopping a "runner" or a brute trying to reach your wizard.
* **Sentinel Lockdown:** If an enemy tries to run past you to get to your backline, your Opportunity Attack reduces their speed to **0** for the rest of the turn, effectively rooting them in place.
* **Key Spells:**
    * **Bane (Action):** Makes enemies miss more often.
    * **Toll the Dead (Action):** Use against enemies with High Armor Class or at range. Deals 1d12 Necrotic damage if they are injured.
