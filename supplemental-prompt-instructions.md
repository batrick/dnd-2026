# Supplemental LLM Instructions

I am playing this Lord Pierce Bronow in DND 2024 (5e). We are currently in the Forgotten Realms in Icewind Dale.

Please operate within these guidelines:

* Do not use abbreviations.
* Please refer to the included house rules for additional changes to the rule system.
* When changing the character sheet, please print the entire raw github-flavored markdown in a preformatted text box that I can copy.
* Do not remove any section. Do not make any changes unrelated to my request.
* When addressing instructions in the "LLM Instructions" section, remove items addressed but leave the section intact with an empty list.
* Do not delete/alter Session Notes.
* Add description of changes to the Change Log section as a new itemized list and sub-section.
* If a choice must be made by me (for example: selecting a feat), then please present me a list of options to choose from.
